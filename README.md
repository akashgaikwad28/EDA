# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Multiple Datasets**

Welcome to my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project repository! In this project, I explore and analyze a variety of datasets to enhance my data analysis skills and uncover valuable insights. This repository acts as a dynamic learning journal where I document the techniques, tools, and approaches I use to dive deep into different types of data.

### **üéØ Project Objective**

The core objectives of this project are:

- **Explore**: Conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on multiple datasets from various domains.
- **Learn**: Understand different data structures, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and interpret descriptive statistics.
- **Document**: Keep an organized and clear record of the analysis process, key findings, and challenges encountered.

### **üîç Analysis Process**

The EDA process for each dataset follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates  
   - Converting data types

2. **Data Exploration**  
   - Generating descriptive statistics  
   - Conducting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses  

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Creating insightful plots like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to uncover data distributions and relationships  
   - Visualizing patterns, trends, and outliers for deeper understanding

4. **Insights & Findings**  
   - Summarizing key patterns, trends, and notable observations  
   - Identifying potential challenges, limitations, and gaps in the data

### **üõ† Tools & Libraries**

The following tools and libraries are used for analysis, manipulation, and visualization:

- **Python Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: Efficient data manipulation and cleaning
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Powerful libraries for data visualization
  - **NumPy**: Performing numerical operations
  - **Scikit-learn**: (If applicable) Feature scaling, data preparation, and simple models
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding, visualization, and documentation
