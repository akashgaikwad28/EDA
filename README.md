Exploratory Data Analysis on Multiple Datasets
Welcome to my EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project repository! In this project, I aim to analyze and understand various datasets to improve my data analysis skills and gain insights into different types of data. This repository will serve as a learning journal to document the techniques, tools, and approaches used for EDA.

Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Explore: Conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on multiple datasets from different domains.
Learn: Understand data structures, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and interpret descriptive statistics.
Document: Maintain a clear and organized record of the analysis process, key findings, and any challenges encountered.
Datasets Used
The datasets analyzed in this project cover various domains, such as:

Dataset 1: Description (e.g., e-commerce sales, social media interactions)
Dataset 2: Description (e.g., healthcare patient data, stock market trends)
Dataset 3: Description (e.g., environmental data, financial records)
Each dataset is analyzed separately to extract unique insights and practice different EDA techniques.

Analysis Process
The EDA process for each dataset includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values
Removing duplicates
Data type conversions
Data Exploration:
Descriptive statistics and data summaries
Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
Data Visualization:
Using plots and charts (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to understand data distributions and relationships
Visualizing patterns and trends for deeper insights
Insights & Findings:
Documenting observations
Summarizing patterns and notable data points
Highlighting potential challenges and data limitations
Tools & Libraries
The following tools and libraries are used for analysis and visualization:

Python Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization
NumPy: Numerical operations
Scikit-learn: (if applicable) Feature scaling, data preparation
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code and documentation.
Notebooks
Each dataset has its own Jupyter Notebook file containing the complete EDA process. Below are the links to each notebook:

EDA on Dataset 3
Key Learnings
Through this project, I aim to:

Strengthen my understanding of the data analysis workflow
Improve my ability to interpret and communicate data insights effectively
Practice the use of Python libraries for data analysis and visualization
Future Improvements
This project is a work-in-progress, and I plan to continuously expand it with more datasets and advanced techniques, such as feature engineering and predictive analysis, as I progress in my data learning journey.
